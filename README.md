 Tower Defense Phase 1

## Intro

I started this project after playing with my son countless hours of Tower Defense games in Roblox. One day he said he wanted a specific type of tower defense game, and that I should be able to make it. He know I'm an engineer. And so I accepted the challenge. I kicked off Roblox Studio and though my backend engineering background helped, it wasn't enough for me to figure out quickly what needed to be done. I realized I needed to learn first how to make a tower defense game, and then I could figure out how to make it in Roblox.

So, I've made a plan, and we are starting with Python and Pygame. We are making a simple Tower Defense game, so we can learn the mechanics, in a phased approach we will be adding more complexity, until we fill ready to port it to Roblox.

## Phase 1

For phase 1, we are building a simple single player tower defense game that runs in Windows with generic shapes as towers and enemies, and a simple start to end track.

I'll consider adding:

-  Different types of towers
-  Different tracks
-  An economy system for towers (selling, upgrading)
-  Varying difficulty levels
-  More randomness.


## How to play

-   Clone the repo
-   Run the game
-   Click on the screen to place a tower
-   Watch the towers attack the enemies
-   Win or lose!
